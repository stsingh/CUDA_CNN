# CUDA Convolutional Neural Network
This project was developed as an exploration into optimizations for common tasks in parallel computing. Each file in the optimizations folder is an example of a optimization, with a short explanation at the top. Copy and paste the kernel file you want to test into the src/layer/custom folder before you start.
